RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a system that combines retrieval of documents with LLM generation to produce context-aware answers. RAG is widely used in chatbots, QA systems, and recommendation engines.

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted database service. It supports vector search and full-text search. You can store both operational data and vector embeddings in Atlas. IP Access Lists allow you to control which clients can connect to your cluster.

SentenceTransformers is a Python library for computing dense vector embeddings from text. Models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 are small, fast, and provide good semantic embeddings.

FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that allows you to build APIs quickly. Uvicorn is an ASGI server commonly used to run FastAPI apps asynchronously.

Docker lets you containerize applications, making it easier to deploy services consistently across different environments. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and Express.js is a lightweight framework for building APIs in Node.js.

Hugging Face hosts many pretrained transformer models, including T5, BERT, GPT, and Flan-T5. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) allows efficient fine-tuning of large models without retraining all weights.

Vector embeddings allow semantic comparison between pieces of text. Cosine similarity is often used to measure closeness. FAISS is a library for fast nearest neighbor search over dense vectors.

Chunking long text into smaller pieces improves retrieval quality in RAG systems. JSON is a common format for exchanging data between services. Python virtual environments help isolate project dependencies.
